# front-door
A server in a docker on my Kube cloud to answer Twilio calls from my building callbox.

# Customization
For base functionality, just rename the example.cfg.prv.js file to cfg.prv.js and enter the phone numbers to be called when the guest tries to connect to tennant. Also set an access code to automate entry to building.
